" This allows you to select some text using Vim's visual mode and then hit *
" and # to search for it elsewhere in the file.  For example, hit V, select
" a strange sequence of characters like '$! $!', and hit star.  You'll find
" all other runs of '$! $!' in the file.

" If you hit <leader>* ("\*" unless you changed the mapleader), vim will
" recursively vimgrep for the word under the cursor or the visual selection.

" Vim's default behavior is to just extend the visual selection to the next
" word that matches the word under the cursor.  Doesn't seem very useful.
